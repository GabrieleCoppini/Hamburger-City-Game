# Hamburger City Game
Welcome to the Hamburger Escape Game! 
Count the movements of the hamburger and test your luck! You will find a counter to keep track of the hamburger movements. My goal was to recreate a retro video game aesthetically and with sound

##  Implementation

I made this little game for the JS basic project for the online academy of start2impact. The project request was to create a counter, but I wanted to unleash my creativity and create a small video game in the style of the 90s.




## Technical requirements

The application must be developed with JavaScript. The use of jQuery is not allowed, and neither is the use of any frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, or others). The use of external JavaScript libraries is allowed if necessary. The +/- buttons and the display of the counter value must be built using DOM manipulation with JavaScript. Once the elements are built with JavaScript, the function to increase and decrease the counter value must be implemented. All additional functionalities deemed necessary are allowed.
